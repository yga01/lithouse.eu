We are builders and we are proud of our houses because of the
techniques and materials that we use. Our houses are robust, sturdy,
they have very high insulation values and the are build to withstand
ages. But all that means nothing when it comes to aesthetics.

A nice design is just that, nice, and that is why we often cooperate
with the architects from OxL. Because no matter how nice our designs
are, these OxL boys always manage to make it nicer. Just a few lines,
a sketch on an A4- sheet and voil√°: nicer! We frankly don't understand
how they do it, but it works each and every time.

Every now and then a client manages to come up with a nice design,
without an architect. Not everybody can do it, but recently in Almere
we built a house for a client who did just that: a few lines on a pice
of paper and presto!

We will add some more photos shortly, at this moment we will have to
do with the pictures we took during the assembly phase. The plot
around the house is still a mess, half the plot is flooded, but ignore
that and you see a beautiful design.
