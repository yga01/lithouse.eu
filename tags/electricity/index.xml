      <description>We were doing a hand-over inspection of a house that we had finished, and then we saw the electricity box. Very often these boxes are a little ehh&amp;hellip; unorganized, to put it kindly. Apparantly the idea is: you close the door, you don&amp;rsquo;t see it, why bother.
But this one was different. Done by an electrician with a little OCD. Very nice!
