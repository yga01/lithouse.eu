      <description>What are the requirements for a foundation for a wooden house? They are nothing specials, i.e., not very different from the requirements for a traditional brick &amp;amp; mortar house foundation. A wooden house is lighter, but we don&amp;rsquo;t think that makes a lot of difference for the foundation itself. For us, as wooden house builders, there are three requirements: the foundation should be flat, it should let us anchor the house firmly, and the pipes and guides for water and electricity should be at the exact right spot.</description>

      <description>Contrary to popular belief, wooden houses have a very high life expectancy. Of course wood should be protected from humidity, but if the owner takes care of his house it will last very long. When designing a wooden house we make sure that water can always escape from the house and that walls are ventilated. What would then be life expectancy of a wooden house?
We have several examples of old wooden houses in Europe.</description>
