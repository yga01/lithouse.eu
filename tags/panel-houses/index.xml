      <description>Next to the Mont Blanc A beautiful three bedroom chalet built in the valley of Mont Blanc mountain, in Les Houches, with a big vide. Splendid view towards the Mont Blanc.
  While building this house we tried to keep traditional local style yet we have implemented some modern details. A contemporaryâ€†look, with Siberian larch cladding on the exterior and a plasterboard finish on the interior.
  Vide One of the nicest features of this house is a vide which allows to enjoy beautiful views of the Mont Blanc mountain.</description>

      <description>Last year we built a panel house in St. Jeans d&amp;rsquo;Aulps, about ten minutes from Morzine in France. And we promised to add some more photo. Here they are.
  It looks like a log house, but like many houses in the Alps it actually is a panel house. We also have photos from the interior and then the difference is more obvious. We will show you later.
  The style is very different from our Eric &amp;amp; Flo or the At &amp;amp; Alet, but this house totally fits in it&amp;rsquo;s environment.</description>

      <description>When we rebuild our website we lost quite some content. A post about a house that we built last year in St. Jean d&amp;rsquo;Aulps (just 10 minutes North of Morzine) also disappeared in cyberspace, so now we place it again.
  Although it looks like a log house, this actually is a panel house. We built the wooden part, a local contractor did the concrete foundation (but we supplied the windows that went into the concrete part).</description>

      <description>Today we started with a new project in The Netherlands. We are going to build a panel house, about 180 m2. The foundation is ready, crane is waiting, assembly crew arrived during the weekend, and Monday morning ten &amp;lsquo;o clock first truck arrived. We will need five trucks for this project.
  There is very little space around the house, the truck can not get there. So we unload one kilometer down the road and place all materials in two containers, which we then drive to the building site.</description>

      <title>Josephine, minimalist to the max</title>

      <description>The Josephine is a combination of panel and cross laminated timber, or CLT. The walls are traditional panel walls that you will see everywhere nowadays, while the overlay structure is made from CLT, 10 cm massive wood. The inside walls are finished with multiplex which creates an industrial interior.
  The glass facade is what it it all about. This house is located on the edge of a small village, overlooking farmland the the South-West.</description>
